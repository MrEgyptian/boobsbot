ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome to BoobsGrowingBot!**

Do you want to grow the **biggest boobs** in the world?  
Iâ€™m sure you do! Just use **/grow** once a day in every chat youâ€™re in to start your journey.  
Climb the leaderboard and show off your curves! ðŸ’–

âœ¨ **How it works:**  
- Each /grow gives you between **-2 cm and +10 cm** of growth.  
- Use **/top** to check who has the biggest boobs in your chat.  
- Every day, one lucky player is crowned **Boobs of the Day** with bonus growth!  

ðŸ”¥ **Extra Features:**  
- **/pvp** â†’ Challenge your friends and bet centimeters. Winner grows, loser shrinks.  
- **/import** â†’ Bring progress from other bots.  
- **/loan** â†’ Reset your size to 0 if youâ€™re too deep in negatives.  
- Play even without adding the bot to groups using **inline mode**: type `@boobsgrowingbot` + space.  

ðŸ’¬ Use **/faq** for more detailed info.  
ðŸ’– Use **/support** if youâ€™d like to help keep this bot alive.  

Now go out there and grow! ðŸŒ±
